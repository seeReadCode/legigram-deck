> The essential distinction between a machine and a tool lies in the degree of independence in the operation from the skill and motive power of the operator: the tool lends itself to manipulation, the machine to automatic action.  The degree of complexity is unimportant.

# Die Politik ist die Lehre vom MÃ¶glichen.
## Politics is the teaching of the possible.

- [Otto von Bismarck](https://books.google.de/books?id=UpUBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA248&dq=%22die+Politik+ist+die+Lehre+vom+M%C3%B6glichen%22&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22die%20Politik%20ist%20die%20Lehre%20vom%20M%C3%B6glichen%22&f=false)

> But it is normally the case that the more we can see of policymakers, the more the policymakers want to take their negotiations somewhere else private. When TV cameras were placed into Congress, official business moved out of the official meetings. 
> Joshua Tauberer, GovTrack.us, https://opengovdata.io/2014/unintended-consequences/

Where are the humans "in the loop"?

---

> What is the use of conquering nature if we fall a prey to nature in the form of unbridled men? What is the use of equipping mankind with mighty powers to move and build and communicate, if the final result of this secure food supply and this excellent organization is to enthrone the morbid impulses of a thwarted humanity?
> Mumford
