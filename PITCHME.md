---

## <!--fit--> 1. Why develop Legigram? 

---

### <!--fit--> Better access<br/> to city council agendas

<!-- who has been, how did you know to go?, agenda, existing solution is slow, unusuable, reduces oversight -->

---

### <!--fit--> Wait...so...
#### <!--fit-->...what does city council do anyway? <br>And what is a city council agenda btw and <br>why does it matter?

<!-- policy making, permitting, zoning, contracts, operations... bitcoin mining --->

---

### <!-- fit --> ‚ÄúTime is really of the essence...

> If a meeting is on a Monday, and they release agenda info on Thursday or Friday, that doesn‚Äôt give people who care about a particular item on council‚Äôs agenda much time to discuss with neighbors or discuss with other interested people or groups. 
>
> Every moment counts.

> The ethos of 'new managerialism' is stripping public services of moral and ethical values and replacing them with the market language of costs, efficiencies, profits and competition. Anything which is not easily quantified becomes undervalued or abandoned.

We want to provide concise, accurate information to users. The app avoids creating unnecessary URLs that might create link rot after Legigram ends. To that end, we link to original documents and canonical Legistar views as much as possible.

That said, UX and UI are paramount. We emphasize the critical data along each steps of the agenda review process. We use a content delivery network, a memory store for API hits (which also help reduce the load on Legistar), server render components, and expires headers to accelerate page load. We adapt the layout adjust for screen sizes and click/tap experiences so that it's easy to navigate on most devices. The text should be scannable and readable so we picked a typeface, DM Sans, that excels in legibility even on small screens, and we try to rein in the long event titles and filenames.


## What exists to help us get better laws?
- Voting
- Donations and lobbying
- Councilperson comms
- Public info sessions
- Public meetings, video streams, advance notice
- Public comment periods

### Who is in the room?
